# Model results

This folder contains the folders with the model results from the different participating teams. To submit your model 
results, please: 

1. [fork](https://github.com/gwmodeling/challenge/fork) this repository;
2. Copy the 'team_example' folder and rename (e.g., 'team_XX');
3. Change the files in the folder;
4. Create a [Pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to the original repository to submit your model.

If you need any help with this submission, please post in the GitHub Discussion Forum.

**Note 1**: Please do not change the names of the files contained in the example folder, only change the data within 
the files.

**Note 2**: The files 'submission_form_NAME.csv' can be used to submit the simulated time series for the date where 
the model results will be evaluated. If you have a simulation with values in between the required dates, you may also 
submit additional files with the full results.

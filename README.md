# The Groundwater Modeling Challenge

This repository contains all the information and materials for the Groundwater Time Series Modeling Challenge. We invite every interested groundwater modeler to model the different hydraulic head time series found in the data folder, and send in their best possible simulated heads time series. 

## Participation rules

- Participants may use any type of model
- No other forcing data than those provided may be used
- The groundwater time series themselves may not be used as model input

## Deadline
The deadline for the challenge is **31/12/2022**. Please make sure to submit before this date. We plan to share the results of this challenge at the EGU General Assembly 2023.

## Submission
Participant can submit their model results as a Pull Request to this Repository, adding a folder with their results in the 'models' folder. The model results must be submitted in a way that they are reproducible, either through the use of scripts (preferred) or detailed description of the modeling process.

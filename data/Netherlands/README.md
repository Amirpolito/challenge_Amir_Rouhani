## Input data description

The following input data is provided to model the head time series. This data was collected from the E-OBS dataset 
v25.0e at 0.1deg grid size.

- Daily Precipitation (RR) in mm/d.
- Daily mean temperature (TG) in degree Celsius.
- Daily minimum temperature (TM) in degree Celsius.
- Daily maximum temperature (TX) in degree Celsius.
- Daily averaged sea level pressure (PP) in hPa.
- Daily averaged relative humidity (HU) in%.
- Daily mean wind speed (FG) in m/s.
- Daily mean global radiation (QQ) in W/m2.

## Calibration and testing data

The head data is split into a training and testing period. Data is provided for the training period. A simulated time 
series has to be provided for the entire period.

- **Training period:** 2000-01-01 to 2015-09-10
- **Testing period:** 2016-01-01 to 2021-12-31
